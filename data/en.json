This is also the period in which the poet became addicted to alcohol, his close relations telling him that Nichita consumed more than two bottles of vodka a day, an addiction which, it is ironic to say, did not create the drunkenness inevitable in such cases, but an almost unnatural lucidity and an artistic effervescence that led to the height of genius. It was, perhaps, the \"necessary pact with the devil\", without which many artists would not have reached the fulfilment of genius"
